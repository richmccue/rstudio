# Data Manipulation with Tidyverse

If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work
through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for
assistance. Have fun!

## 1. Getting Ready for Tidyverse : Installing Packages

One of the most fascinating things about R is that it has an active
community developing a lot of packages everyday, which makes R powerful.
A package is a compilation of functions (data sets, code, documentations
and tests) external to R that provide it with additional capabilities.

We can install packages in the console using the `install.packages()`
function.

<br>

#### [Task 1.1:]{.underline} Install the tidyverse package.

| Package name: tidyverse

<details>
<summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") #then, as always, type 'enter' or 'return' to submit the command for execution
```
</details>
| *Hint:* wrap the package name in `""` quotations, as it is a string
type.

*Note:* The installation may take a while, sometimes up to 10-15
minutes. When it's complete, the right angle bracket `>` will appear at
the last line of your console.

After we install a package, we have to load it, using the `library()`
function. Do not wrap the package name in quotes when using `library()`

<details>

<summary>Why no quotations for library()?</summary>

When you install a package in R using **`install.packages()`**, the
package name must be a character string, hence the quotes. This is
because **`install.packages()`** is a function that takes a character
vector as its argument, representing the names of the packages to be
installed.

However, when you load a package using **`library()`** or
**`require()`**, you're not passing a character string; instead, you're
using a non-evaluated expression that refers to the package name. Here,
the package name is an object of mode "name" which **`library()`**
interprets as the name of a package to load.

In summary, the quotes are needed for **`install.packages()`** because
it expects a character string, while **`library()`** is designed to take
an unquoted name that it interprets as a package name.

</details>

<br>

#### [Task 1.2:]{.underline} Load the 'tidyverse' library.

<details>

<summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

</details>

*Note:* You only need to install a package once, but you need to reload it every time you start a new session.

## 2. Getting data
<br>

#### [Task 2.1:]{.underline} Download data about purchase orders 
- We will use this data for the tasks in this activity.

<img src="images/messy_purchase_orders.png" alt="purchase orders photo" style="float:right;width:180px;"/>


Download [this](https://uviclibraries.github.io/rstudio/docs/Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv){:target="\_blank"} file and use it to do the tasks in this activity.

*Note:* Activities 3 and 4 draw from Kaggle's [Manipulating Data with
the
Tidyverse](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rtatman/manipulating-data-with-the-tidyverse/notebook){:target="\_blank"}.

## 3: Preparing our Workspace

**Before moving ahead,** ensure that you have installed and loaded the
tidyverse package.

In this activity, we will be working with a table containing information
about shipping orders Each row represents one order, and each column
represents a specific type of data pertaining to the orders
<br>

#### [Task 3.1:]{.underline} Read in your data set.

Data set file name: `Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv` through either of the following to ways:

To import:

[Option a:]{.underline}

- Click the **Files** tab in the lower right panel
- Navigate to the **Global_Superstore_Orders_2016s.csv** file
- then click on this file
- and click **Import data set**
- In the pop-out window, change the data set’s name to **purchaseData**
- then click **Import**.

If your file isn't visible in the main Files window, click the ...
button on the far right hand side of the files panel, across from the
Home button, immediately above the ‘Modified’ column header. This will
open the file explorer and you can search from your entire computer.


<details><summary>Show gif of import dataset</summary>
![](images/tidyverse-02.gif)

</details>

[Option b:]{.underline}

  Load your data in via the console using the `read.csv()` function.

  -   The parameter this function takes is the filepath to your data,
        followed by the file name.
      -   i.e. *[your/file/path/filename.extension]*
      
  - Rename your dataset to `purchaseData`

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#if your file cannot be found, enter `getwd()` into your console and it will tell you the file path you should most likely use. If you cannot find the file, use Option a.
purchaseData <- read.csv("Desktop/Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv")
```

```{r load-data, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
purchaseData <- read.csv("/Users/chloefarr/Documents/GitHub/rstudio/docs/Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv")
```
</details>

<br>
For larger data sets, it's better to preview than view our data. This
data set has quite a few columns and rows! Let's take a look at the first
few rows and get the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the
data set.

We can preview the data set using the `head()` function. This will
display the first number of rows. 
        
  Parameters 
  
  - data set name 
  - number of rows to display

<br>

#### [Task 3.2:]{.underline} Look at the first 5 rows of our purchase data.
<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# name of data set name: "purchaseData"
# number of rows to display: 5
head(purchaseData, 5)
```

</details>
*Hint:* `head(*datasetName*, *numberOfRows*)`

<br>

The following will be the output (only showing 6 columns for display
purposes. Your output will be much wider!):

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(purchaseData[,1:6], n=5)
```

<br> 

#### [Task 3.3:]{.underline} Find out the dimensions of the table, i.e., number of rows and columns. 

We can find out the dimensions (rows and columns) using the`dim()` function. 

Now, we've imported our data and previewed the first 10 rows of our purchase data, but how big is the data set?
  
  - How many rows?
  - How many columns?


  Parameter: dataset name


Get the dimensions of the purchase dataset.
<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r}
## name of data set name: "purchaseData"
dim(purchaseData)
```

</details>
<br>

## 4. Introducing Piping

`%>%` This symbol is known as a "pipe," and it's used for feeding the
result of one function directly into the next function. 

  - E.g., To sort the column names alphabetically, you could either enter:
    - two separate commands creating two data objects
    - utilize piping to create one data object for your target object. 

In pipes, you can choose to have a newline (shift+enter) after the %\>% symbol or leave it all on one line.
<br>

### 4.1 Before Piping

Piping allows us to perform multiple functions at once to achieve a
single result. So far, we have looked at commands that perform single
operations. 

- Create a variable whose value is a single word
  - `y <- "word"` 
- Create a variable whose value by mathematical expression 
  - `x <- 1-2`
- viewing the dimensions of a data set
  - `dim(purchaseData)`

What if we want to get a list of column names in our data set, AND sort
it alphabetically? 

  - There are 2 ways that we can do this without the tidyverse package based on what we've already learned.

<br>

#### [Task 4.1.1:]{.underline} Create an object containing the list of column names from our purchase data. 

To get a list of our column names we can use the `names()` function.

  - In this case, results in a vector, because all of the column names are strings of characters

    Name this object 'purchaseDataColumnNames'
    
<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r}
purchaseDataColumnNames <- names(purchaseData)
```

</details>

<br>

#### [Task 4.1.2:]{.underline} Create an object containing the list of column names from our purchase data that is sorted alphabetically. 

We can sort vectors into ascending and descending order (low to high or high to low) using the `sort()` function. 

First, let's look at each of these functions on their own.

  - Name this object 'alphaPurchaseDataColumnNames'
  - Parameter: the vector of column names
  
<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r}
alphaPurchaseDataColumnNames <- sort(purchaseDataColumnNames)
```

</details>

| *Hint:* You already created the vector containing the list of column names from our purchase data! <br>
<br>
In Tasks 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, we ran two commands resulting in two separate
variables containing the column names: 
  
  - `purchaseDataColumnNames`: Ordered as they would be if the file were opened in excel 
  - `alphaPurchaseDataColumnNames`: Ordered alphabetically (sorted)

<br>
However, if we don't care about the list of column names *unless* they are sorted alphabetically:
  
  - we can achieve that using only 1 command,
    - creating only 1 variable with "nesting". 

<br>
**Definition - Nesting:** Use one function as a parameter of another function. 

  - e.g., `function1(function2(parameter))`
  
<br>

#### [Task 4.1.3:]{.underline} In this task, use nesting to create 1 variable containing a sorted vector of the column names. 

  -  Name this variable: `alphabeticalColumnNames`
<br>

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r}
#names(purchaseData) creates a vector object of the column names from our purchase data
# sort() Orders the items in the purchase data column names alphabetically
alphabeticalColumnNames <- sort(names(purchaseData))
```

</details>

<br>
*Hints*: the parameter of `names()` is the `sort()` function, and the parameter of `sort()` is the dataset
<br>
As you might imagine, nesting could result in very long commands that would be hard to interpret. 

There is a cleaner way to do this than nesting: Piping! 

---

### 4.2 Piping

To pipe a command instead of nesting, we will enter the commands sequentially, separated by the pipe symbol `%>%`.

- Creating a new variable with 2 criteria (functions or expressions): newVariable \<- criteria1() %\>% criteria2()

- Previewing our data with 2 criteria: criteria1() %\>% criteria2()

<br> 

#### [Task 4.2.1:]{.underline} In this task, use piping to create 1 variable containing the first 5 column names. 
  
  - Do not use objects you have created so far, except `purchaseData` 
  - Name your new variable: `purchaseDataNamesPeek`
<br>

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>

```{r}
# 'purchaseDataNamesPeek <-' creates a new variable
# 'names(purchaseData)' retrieves the column names from our purcgase data as a vector
# The pipe '%>%' passes the names vector to the 'head()' function
# 'head(5)' then extracts the first five elements (columns) of this vector
# The result is a 5-item vector of column names assigned to 'purchaseDataNamesPeek'
purchaseDataNamesPeek <- names(purchaseData) %>% head(5)

#remember, you can view the value assigned to a variable by entering just that variable name
purchaseDataNamesPeek
```

</details>

<br>
*Hint*: the parameter of `names()` is the `head()` function. <br>
<br>

If you want to simply view what the first five column names are, but don't need to reference them later, you don't need to create a new variable.
<br>

<details><summary>Show code for previewing with piping</summary>

```{r}
names(purchaseData) %>% head(5)
```

</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we work with data, it can be useful to work with smaller sections of data. 

In the remainder of activity 4, we will look at ways to select subsets of our data to make it easier to work with. 

 - We will use piping to filter productData based on different conditions, such as:
    - Previewing only the column names that begin with `Product` 
    - Previewing only the purchases from Tampa Bay 
    - Previewing only the purchases that are corporate orders
    - Previewing only the purchases from Tampa that aren't critical priority
  

Before we begin to filter, we need to look at Operators.

 **Definition - "Operators":** Special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on arguments
  - logical operators specifically designed for connecting or modifying boolean (true/false) logic statements.
 <br>
 
**Operators**

- Logical operators
   - \< means "less than"
   - \<= means "less than or equal to"
   - \> means "greater than"
   - \>= means "greater than or equal to"
   - == means "exactly equal to"
   - != means "not equal to"
- Connecting logical statements:
     - x \| y means "x or y"
     - x & y means "x and y"

------------------------------------------------------------------------


### 4.3 Selecting specific columns

The commands in this section (4.3) will not create data objects as we won't be using them later on. 

  **- End each command in this section with `%>% head(5)`**
  
  - Not ending functions that extract full columns of data will display a LOT. 
  
  - This will make things easier for you. 

<br> 

#### [Task 4.3.1:]{.underline} Preview the values in the Row ID column 

To get a specific column, use piping and the `select()` function on your
data set. 

  - The parameter is the name of the column you want to access.


- Column name: `Row_ID`

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
#data set %>% select the column titled `Row ID` and view the first 5 items.
purchaseData %>% select(Row_ID) %>% head(5)
```
</details>

*Hint:* Begin with the name of the data set, followed by your select function passing in the column name as the parameter.


<br>

#### [Task 4.3.2:]{.underline} Select all the columns from your purchase data that do *not* start with "Postal_Code".

<br>
To select all of the columns from our data set that do *not* start with specific text, we do the inverse, 
  
  - again using the `select()` function
  - the parameter has a `-` before the string value we want to exclude.

<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData %>% select(-Postal_Code) %>% head(5)
```
</details>
<br>


#### [Task 4.3.3:]{.underline} Select all the columns from our cleaned purchase data that start with "Product".

We can also select a set of columns. 
  
  - E.g., columns whose names begin with a common string of characters. 
  
  - This will return a subset of our table, not necessarily a single vector
  
  
In our dataset, multiple column names begin with "Product". We want to see only the data of columns whose names begin with "Product."

<br>

Here's how it's done:

- Use piping on your purchaseData 
  
  - `purchaseData %>%`
    
- Use the `select()` function to select the columns
  
- Use the `starts_with()` function as the parameter for `select()`
  
  - notes that you're selecting all columns that start with a specific name
    
    - rather one column that is exactly equal or not equal to a specific value
        
- The parameter for `starts_with()` is the value of the beginning of all columns you want to select. 
  
<br>

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
#selecting all columns (and their values) from purchaseData whose names begin with "Product"
purchaseData %>% select(starts_with("Product")) %>% head(5)
```
</details>


<br>

### 4.4 Select specific rows based on a condition

While we may only want to handle certain items (rows) in our dataset based on certain criteria.

  - This is called "filtering." 

  - We can filter for different purposes, like processing statistical operations, making charts and so on.
      
  - We can even create new data objects, which can make future analyses easier.

<br>

#### [Task 4.4.1:]{.underline} Filter all the rows from your purchase data where `Quantity` is greater than 10.

To select items (rows, *not* columns), we use the `filter()` function.


<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData %>% filter(Quantity > 10) %>% head(5)
```
</details>

*Hint:* `>` is the ‘greater than’ operator.

<br>

#### [Task 4.4.2:]{.underline} Filter all the rows from your purchase data where `City` is "Sydney".

<details>
<summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData %>% filter(City == "Sydney") %>% head(5)
```
</details>

*Hint:* `==` is used for "equal to"

<br>

#### [Task 4.4.3:]{.underline} Create a new dataframe with all the rows from purchaseData where `Country` is "United States" and `Discount` is greater than 0.

  - Name this dataframe: `discountedUSPurchases`
  
  **- Do not add " %>% head(5)" to the command when creating a new dataframe**
  
<details>
<summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
discountedUSPurchases <- purchaseData %>% filter(Country == "United States" & Discount > 0)


#view your dataframe
discountedUSPurchases %>% head(5)
```
</details>
*Hint:* `&` is used for "and", in cases where you want to manage multiple cases like filtering my two variables<br>
  - e.g., values of the `Sub_Category` and `Order_Priority` columns.
<br>


### 4.5  Modify a dataframe with 'mutate'

"Mutation" involves creating or altering columns in a data frame, 

  - using the `mutate()` function
    - e.g., If you have a column with a range of numbers, but you want to be able to quickly work with the data only over or under a specific value, like any orders under $10, you can create a "Cheap" column and the values would be TRUE or FALSE.
  - adds new variables or modifies existing ones.


<br>
[Here's how we'll do it:]{.underline}

  - Assign the mutation (modification) to an existing variable 
    - `existing_dataframe_name <-`
    
  - Identify the existing variable name of the object you want to mutate
    - `purchaseData`
    
  - Use a pipe to identify the action being performed on our existing variable
    - `%>%`
    
  - Identify that the action being performed on the existing variable is the mutation
    - using the `mutate()` function
    
  - Pass the condition in as the parameter for the `mutate` function
    - If we want to add a variable (column), begin the parameter of `mutate()` with `new_column_name = ` 
      - `=` means the values assigned to each item in that column is generated by the following condition
      - The new column name is `Low_Priority` and is followed by `= (condition)`
    - Say we want to add a column that has a TRUE/FALSE variable (aka boolean) for whether the order priority is low.
      - The condition will be `Order_Priority == "Low"`
        - `==` means "the left value is equal to the right value"
          - aka. The result will be everything in the data that is "Low"
    
<details><summary>Check your code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData <- purchaseData %>% mutate(Low_Priority = (Order_Priority == "Low"))

#view your dataframe
purchaseData %>% head(5)
```
</details>
<br>

#### [Task 4.5.2:]{.underline} Now try it yourself. Add a new boolean (TRUE/FALSE) variable (column) to the purchase data that identifies whether a purchase's shipping cost is greater than 100 dollars.

  - Name the new column: `High_Shipping`
  - The value will be TRUE if the `Shipping_Cost` value is over (`>`) 100.


<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData <- purchaseData %>% mutate(High_Shipping = (Shipping_Cost > 100))

#view your dataframe
purchaseData %>% head(5)
```
</details>

*Hint:* `Shipping_Cost > 100`


<br>

#### [Task 4.5.3:]{.underline} Add a new column based on TWO conditions

Add a new variable `Discounted_US` that is TRUE if the purchase is made in the United States and has been discounted
  
  - Filter for United States orders using the `Country` column
  - Filter for discounted orders by selecting all objects where the values in the `Discount` column are greater than 0.

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r} 
purchaseData <- purchaseData %>% mutate(Discounted_US = (Country == "United States" & Discount > 0))
#We can then get summary of our new variable values (i.e., the number or True values and number of False values in the new 'Discounted_US' column)
#request a summary of the values in the table $ column name
summary(purchaseData$Discounted_US)
```
</details>

*Hint:* `logicalStatement & logicalStatement`

<br>

### 4.6 Sorting data with `arrange()`

Being able to arrange data by ordering values numerically or alphabeticaly is particularly handy for swiftly identifying which measurements recorded the highest or lowest values.


**`sort()` will not work on a dataframe**
**CHLOE: ADD SOME SORT OF GRAPHIC**
<br>

#### [Task 4.6.1:]{.underline} Update the purchaseData to sort objects by price (low to high).

The `arrange()` function enables you to order your data frame according to the values of a specific variable. 

  - This is particularly handy for swiftly identifying which measurements recorded the highest or lowest values.

When using `arrange()`, you specify the column name that you wish to organize by. 

  - In this case, it will arrange the data based on the sales value 
    - a new variable that we recently formulated using `mutate()`


- Parameter of `arrange()` is `Sales`

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
purchaseData <- purchaseData %>% arrange(Sales)

#view your dataframe
purchaseData %>% head(5)
```
</details>
*Hint:* Do not wrap the column name in quotations.

### 4.7 Summarizing variables with summarize

<br>

#### [Task 4.7.1:]{.underline} Use the `summarise()` function to synthesize information in a data frame with the mean Sales value and median discount amount 

To summarise information in your data table, you can get information like totals, averages, medians, and so on.

`summarise()` takes an unlimited number of parameters, where each parameter will appear as a column.

- parameter 1: `columnName = mean(column)`
- another parameter: `columnName2 = mean(another column)`


Preview the mean sales values and mean discount values in the discounted US purchases data.


<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
#Only purchases made in the US with discounts
discountedUSPurchases %>% 
   #average sale price and average discount
   summarise(meanSales = mean(Sales), meanDiscount = mean(Discount))%>%
      #finish the command with view() to preview this
      view() 

#To retrieve this data later, assign this command to a new variable.
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Only purchases made in the US with discounts
discountedUSPurchasesSummarize <- discountedUSPurchases %>% 
   # Average sale price and average discount
   summarise(meanSales = mean(Sales), meanDiscount = mean(Discount))

# Print the result
print(discountedUSPurchasesSummarize)
```
</details>

*Hint:* Both spellings, `summarize` or `summarise`, will work.


### 4.8 Analyzing groups with group_by

Let's say we wanted to know how profitable each US city is. We can get the average profit, but grouped by US city. From this, we can sort by profit to see what the most and least profitable cities are.


#### [Task 4.8.1:]{.underline} Create a dataframe of US Cities and their average profit for each 

  - You will use the `discountedUSPurchases` dataframe to create this new dataframe
  - Name the new dataframe `USCityProfits`
  - You will use `group_by()` with `City`, where each row will be a city
  - You will use `summarise()` function to get the summary statistics for each city
  - The statistic you will be summarizing total `Profit` values on purchases made in the US where the items have been discounted.
  
  **! Don't add `head(5)` when creating a new variable.**

<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
```{r}
#Only purchases made in the US with discounts
USCityProfits <- discountedUSPurchases %>% 
      group_by(City) %>% # group by city purchase was made in
      summarise(totalProfit = sum(Profit)) # average profit for each city
```
</details>
<br>

The table will be sorted by city, alphabetically
  
  - Sort the table by `Profit` using the `arrange()` function. to order it by the lowest profitable city to the highest profitable city
  
<br>
<details><summary>Check Your Code</summary>
