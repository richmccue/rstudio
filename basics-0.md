# Getting Started for Mere Mortals - Data types, Basic commands & Charting
If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. **Getting familiar with the RStudio Interface**
    - ![Code Editor, R console, Workplace and Plots](images/rstudio-01.png)
    - Open RStudio and get familiar with the interface by finding 4 windows
    - In the console in the bottom left window type: <code>help(mean)</code> and then press enter on your keyboard. 
    - This will provide you with information about the mean function in RStudio. The help information will be displayed in the bottom right window.<br>

2. **Data types and entering data**
- Create a new RScript by selecting the **File** menu then **New File** and then **R script**.
- ![create a new Rscript file](images/rstudio-03.gif)
-  **Vectors (lists of numbers or text)**: 
    - In the Code Editor or script window (top left), enter miniature goat weight data into a vector by typing: <code>goat.weight <- c(14.6, 17.2, 14.8, 13.3, 16.4)</code>
    - Press **cmd + enter** on a Mac, or **control + enter** on Windows to execute the line.
    - ![Adding goat data](images/rstudio-04.gif)
    - Note that the command you just ran magically appeared in your console in the bottom left window, and the values from the goat.weight vector appeared in your top right window.<br>
    -  ![bottom left console with text](images/rstudio-05.png)
    -  Type <code>print(goat.weight)</code> to print the contents of the vector in the console (bottom left window).
    -  Copy, paste and run this command: <code>goat.name <- c("baby", "gabbie", "pickles", "cookie", "sparkle")</code>
    -  Type or copy & paste, <code>length(goat.name)</code> and then run in order to count the number of goat names in the vector.<br>
    -  ![Adding length(goat.name)](images/rstudio-06.gif)<br>
- **Variables (text and numeric)**: 
    -  Type <code>name1='gabbie'</code> then run.
    -  Type <code>v1<-6</code> then run.
    -  Type <code>v2<-4</code> then run.
    -  Type <code>print(v1+v2)</code> and then run. The result in the console on the bottom left will be 10 of course.<br>
    -  ![adding variables above](images/rstudio-07.gif)<br>
- **Logical or boolean values**: 
    - Type <code>goats.mini=TRUE</code> and <code>goats.large=F</code> . T is short for TRUE and F is short for FALSE. These variables should also appear in the top right window.<br>
    - ![logical or boolean values](images/rstudio-08.gif)<br>
    - Display all objects you have created by typing the following into the bottom left console window and pressing enter: <code>ls()</code> (Please note that “**l**” is a letter)<br
    - ![adding ls()](images/rstudio-09.gif)<br>
    - Save your script by clicking on the top menu bar: **File -> Save**
    - Remove the “name1” object by typing in the console: <code>rm(name1)</code><br>
    - ![removing name1](images/rstudio-10.gif)<br>

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Input data with this command: <code>goat.weight<-c(22, 27, 19, 25, 12, 22, 18)</code>
- Mean: If you want to find the average or mean of goat.weight, you can enter the command <code>mean(goat.weight)</code> in the console window. This should return 20.71429
- Median: Similarly for the median enter the command <code>median(goat.weight)</code>. Answer: 22
- Summary: You can also use the summary command to generate several descriptive statistics at the same time: <code>summary(goat.weight)</code> 
- Standard deviation: enter: <code>sd(goat.weight)</code>  Answer: 4.956958

4. **Histogram Plot for goat data**
- Histograms can be created using the hist() function. This function takes in a vector of values for which the histogram is plotted.
- Enter <code>hist(goat.weight)</code> in the command line. The histogram will appear to the right.
- We can also pass in additional parameters to control the way our plot looks. Some of the frequently used ones are main to give the title, **xlab** and **ylab** to provide labels for the axes. 
- Enter <code>hist(goat.weight,main='Histogram of Goat Weight',xlab='Weight')</code><br>

5. **Read or Import an Excel spreadsheet into R-Studio** 
![Import Tab](images/rstudio-15.png)
- [Download and save the following Excel spreadsheet](docs/income.xlsx){:target="_blank"}<br>
Note: Please remember where the income.xlsx file is saved (usually in a “downloads” or “desktop” folder).
- Import the dataset by clicking **File -> Import dataset -> From Excel** and click **Yes** to install the “**readxl**” package.
- Click Browse to find the excel file. Select the **income.xlsx** file, and then **Open**. Now click **Import**.
![Browse and import menu and buttons](images/rstudio-16.png)
- List the whole dataset in the console by typing: <code>income</code> 
![Income list](images/rstudio-17.png)
- Calculate the descriptive statistics for the income dataset by typing in the console: <code>summary(income)</code>
![Income summary list](images/rstudio-18.png)
![Demonstration of step 5](images/rstudio-19.gif)
6. **Histogram plot**
- Histograms can be created using the hist() function. This function takes in a vector of values for which the histogram is plotted.
- Enter <code>hist(income$experience)</code> in the command line. The histogram will appear to the right.
- You can see there is a histogram plot coming out in the plot window. We can see that there are 7 cells with equally spaced breaks. In this case, the height of a cell is equal to the number of observations falling in that cell.
- We can also pass in additional parameters to control the way our plot looks. Some of the frequently used ones are **main** to give the title, **xlab** and **ylab** to provide labels for the axes. 
- Enter <code>hist(income$experience,main='Histogram of Experience',xlab='Experience')</code><br>
